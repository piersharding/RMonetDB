== Summary

Welcome to the RMonetDB R module.  This module is intended to facilitate SQL calls to the MonetDB database using the MAPI client library interface, and doing native conversions between column and data.frame types.

Prerequisites:
Please insure that YAML is installed:
install.packages('yaml')

Installation:
See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

Examples:
See the files in the tests/ directory.

Documentation:
help(RMonetDB)

Test suite:
To run the test suite you must load the test 'voc' data base available at http://www.monetdb.org/Documentation/SQLrecipies

Or, alternatively, load the version supplied in the data directory by doing the following:

sudo /etc/init.d/monetdb5-sql start
sudo -u monetdb monetdb status

sudo -u monetdb monetdb stop voc    # only if voc already exists
sudo -u monetdb monetdb destroy voc # only if voc already exists
sudo -u monetdb monetdb create voc
sudo -u monetdb monetdb start voc
sudo -u monetdb monetdb release voc
sudo -u monetdb monetdb status

gunzip -c ./voc-export-all.csv.gz | mclient -u monetdb -d voc

The default password for the user 'monetdb' is 'monetdb'

Once the 'voc' database is imported, the password for the user 'voc' is 'voc'

login:
mclient -h localhost -u voc -d voc

To run the tests:
rm run_tests.Rout; R CMD BATCH run_tests.R; more run_tests.Rout

I appreciate bug reports and patches, just mail me! piers@ompka.net
